# Inconsistent Tailwind CSS Styling Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS styles are not applied consistently across components or pages.  This can manifest as missing background colors, incorrect shadows, or other style discrepancies.  The likely causes include conflicting styles, typos in class names, or missing/misconfigured Tailwind dependencies.

## Bug Description
The `bug.js` file contains a React component (or similar) that demonstrates the inconsistent styling.  The component is expected to have a gray background, padding, rounded corners, and a shadow, but these styles are either partially or completely missing.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to fix the issue.  The solution may involve:

* **Correcting class names:** Double-check all class names for typos or inconsistencies.
* **Resolving style conflicts:** Identify and resolve conflicting styles by using more specific selectors or adjusting the CSS order.
* **Verifying Tailwind installation:**  Ensure Tailwind CSS is correctly installed and configured in your project.
* **Purge unused styles:** Run `npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch` to ensure all unused styles are removed.  This can improve performance and prevent unexpected behavior.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` (or `yarn install`)
3. Run the application (instructions will depend on your framework). 
4. Observe the inconsistent styling on the affected component(s).
5. Compare the `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` files to see the solution.
